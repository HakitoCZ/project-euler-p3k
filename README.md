Solutions of Python problems of Project Euler (dot) net

I know, most of the given problems probably have better/faster/shorter solution but meh. I'm beginner and I am honestly glad that my skills reach the solution.

Project euler offer mathematical/logical problems which can be used as a training of your very programming skills.

Since I, even while watching some expanationary vid, look like not-very-confident person, this is great opportunity to solve problems which doesn't overreach my possibilities.
